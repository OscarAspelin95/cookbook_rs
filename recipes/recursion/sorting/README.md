# Problem
You need to implement your own recursive sorting function that also can be generic over Vec<T> where T: PartialOrd.

# Solution
Implement a variant of quicksort/mergesort that recursively sorts the input.

# Notes
We are not aiming for implementing the most performant sorting algorithm. Rather, understanding how recursion works in Rust.
