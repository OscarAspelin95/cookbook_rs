# Problem
You need to implement your own recursive sorting function for a Vec<i64>.

# Solution
Implement a variant of quicksort/mergesort that recursively sorts the input.

# Notes
We are not aiming for implementing the most performant sorting algorithm. Rather, understanding how recursion works in Rust.
