# Problem
You want to practice creating a stack-like datastructure over a generic type `T`.

# Solution
Implement a wrapper struct around `Vec`.

# Note
This example showcases the usage of generics, but that is about it. Since `Vec` basically already is a stack, this example essentially only incorporates boilerplate code. It is however a good excercise for working with generics in a struct.
